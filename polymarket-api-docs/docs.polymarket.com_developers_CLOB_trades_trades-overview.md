## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/trades/trades-overview\#overview)  Overview

All historical trades can be fetched via the Polymarket CLOB REST API. A trade is initiated by a “taker” who creates a marketable limit order. This limit order can be matched against one or more resting limit orders on the associated book. A trade can be in various states as described below. Note: in some cases (due to gas limitations) the execution of a “trade” must be broken into multiple transactions which case separate trade entities will be returned. To associate trade entities, there is a bucket\_index field and a match\_time field. Trades that have been broken into multiple trade objects can be reconciled by combining trade objects with the same market\_order\_id, match\_time and incrementing bucket\_index’s into a top level “trade” client side.
