In the Getting Started tutorial on [Making your First Trade](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/get-started/making-your-first-trade/), we learned about market orders.In a market order, your trade executes instantly at the current market price.But what if you think the market price is too high and want to set a specific price that you would be willing to accept? These are called [Limit Orders](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/limit-orders/).

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/using-the-orderbook\#viewing-the-order-book)  Viewing the Order Book

The order book is a list of every open order to buy or sell shares in a particular market.

In this market, **“Presidential Election Winner 2024”**, we are viewing the order book for Trump Yes shares.The green side represents the Bids: the highest price traders are willing to pay to buy Trump Yes
shares.The red side represents the Asks: the lowest price traders are willing to accept to sell Trump Yes shares.

Notice that there is a 0.3c gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask price. This is referred to as the spread.
