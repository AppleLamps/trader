## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/limit-orders\#what-are-limit-orders)  What are Limit Orders?

Limit orders are open orders (pending trades) that only execute when the market trades at your desired price.For example, if the highest you’re willing to pay for a share of Trump “Yes” in the 2024 Republican Nomination is 72c, but the current market price is 73c, you could create a limit order at 72c and wait until someone is willing to sell Yes shares at your desired price.

It’s not necessary for the entire order to execute at once. Limit orders can ‘partially fill’ as individual traders fill parts of your order.

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/limit-orders\#managing-limit-orders)  Managing limit orders

When you have an open order, you’ll find it displayed just below the Order Book on the market’s page.If you have open orders across multiple markets, you can easily manage and monitor them all from the [Portfolio page](https://polymarket.com/portfolio?tab=Open+orders).

Specifically for sports markets, any outstanding limit orders are automatically cancelled once the game begins, clearing the entire order book at the official start time. Be aware, game start times can shift so it’s important to always monitor your orders closely in case they are not cleared due to game changes or other circumstances.

Additionally, sports markets include a 3-second delay on the placement of marketable orders.

When you have an open order, you’ll find it displayed just below the Order Book on the market’s page.To cancel the order, you can simply click the red **x** button alongside the order.
