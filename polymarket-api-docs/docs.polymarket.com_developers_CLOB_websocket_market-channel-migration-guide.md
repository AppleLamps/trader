### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/websocket/market-channel-migration-guide\#key-differences)  Key Differences

| Aspect | Legacy Schema | New Schema |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Root level asset\_id** | Present | Removed |
| **Changes array** | `changes` | `price_changes` |
| **Asset ID location** | Root level | Inside each price change object |
| **Hash location** | Root level | Inside each price change object |
| **Best bid/ask** | Not included | Included in each change |
| **Side values** | ”SELL”, “BUY" | "SELL”, “BUY” (unchanged) |

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/websocket/market-channel-migration-guide\#handle-new-fields)  Handle New Fields

The new schema provides additional market data:

- **`best_bid`**: Current best bid price for the asset
- **`best_ask`**: Current best ask price for the asset
- **`hash`**: Now provided per price change rather than per message

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/websocket/market-channel-migration-guide\#benefits-of-the-new-schema)  Benefits of the New Schema

- **Enhanced market data**: Best bid/ask prices are now included
- **Granular change tracking**: Hash values are provided per change rather than per message
- **Clearer structure**: The reorganized schema makes the relationship between market, assets, and changes more explicit

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/websocket/market-channel-migration-guide\#timeline)  Timeline

- **Go-live**: **September 15, 2025 at 11PM UTC**
- **Legacy support**: None, these changes are not backwards compatible

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/websocket/market-channel-migration-guide\#testing-your-migration)  Testing Your Migration

1. **Update your parsing logic** following the examples above
2. **Verify handling of new fields** like `best_bid` and `best_ask`
3. **Check error handling** for the new structure
