## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/markets/how-are-markets-clarified\#overview)  Overview

- Markets are resolved according to the rules set forth on the market page.
- The rules specify the resolution source, the market end date, and they outline how the market should resolve in various edge-cases.
- The market title describes the market, but the rules define how it should be resolved.

In rare cases, circumstances occur that were not foreseen at a market’s creation and it becomes necessary to clarify rules after trading has begun. In these cases Polymarket may issue an “Additional context” update to the rules.

If you believe a clarification is necessary for a market, the best place to request a clarification is in the [Polymarket Discord](https://discord.com/invite/polymarket) **#market-review** channel.
