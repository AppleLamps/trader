## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#overview)  Overview

Market makers need to manage their inventory of outcome tokens. This involves:

1. **Splitting** USDCe into YES/NO tokens to have inventory to quote
2. **Merging** tokens back to USDCe to reduce exposure
3. **Redeeming** winning tokens after market resolution

All these operations use the Conditional Token Framework (CTF) contract, typically via the Relayer Client for gasless execution.

These examples assume you have initialized a RelayClient. See [Setup](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/setup) for client initialization.

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#splitting-usdce-into-tokens)  Splitting USDCe into Tokens

Split 1 USDCe into 1 YES + 1 NO token. This creates inventory for quoting both sides.

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#via-relayer-client-recommended)  Via Relayer Client (Recommended)

Copy

```
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { Interface } from "ethers/lib/utils";
import { RelayClient, Transaction } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";

const CTF_ADDRESS = "0x4d97dcd97ec945f40cf65f87097ace5ea0476045";
const USDCe_ADDRESS = "0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174";

const ctfInterface = new Interface([\
  "function splitPosition(address collateralToken, bytes32 parentCollectionId, bytes32 conditionId, uint[] partition, uint amount)"\
]);

// Split $1000 USDCe into YES/NO tokens
const amount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 6); // USDCe has 6 decimals

const splitTx: Transaction = {
  to: CTF_ADDRESS,
  data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("splitPosition", [\
    USDCe_ADDRESS,                                    // collateralToken\
    ethers.constants.HashZero,                       // parentCollectionId (null for Polymarket)\
    conditionId,                                     // conditionId from market\
    [1, 2],                                          // partition: [YES, NO]\
    amount\
  ]),
  value: "0"
};

const response = await client.execute([splitTx], "Split USDCe into tokens");
const result = await response.wait();
console.log("Split completed:", result?.transactionHash);
```

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#result)  Result

After splitting 1000 USDCe:

- Receive 1000 YES tokens
- Receive 1000 NO tokens
- USDCe balance decreases by 1000

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#merging-tokens-to-usdce)  Merging Tokens to USDCe

Merge equal amounts of YES + NO tokens back into USDCe. Useful for:

- Reducing inventory
- Exiting a market
- Converting profits to USDCe

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#via-relayer-client)  Via Relayer Client

Copy

```
const ctfInterface = new Interface([\
  "function mergePositions(address collateralToken, bytes32 parentCollectionId, bytes32 conditionId, uint[] partition, uint amount)"\
]);

// Merge 500 YES + 500 NO back to 500 USDCe
const amount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("500", 6);

const mergeTx: Transaction = {
  to: CTF_ADDRESS,
  data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("mergePositions", [\
    USDCe_ADDRESS,\
    ethers.constants.HashZero,\
    conditionId,\
    [1, 2],\
    amount\
  ]),
  value: "0"
};

const response = await client.execute([mergeTx], "Merge tokens to USDCe");
await response.wait();
```

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#result-2)  Result

After merging 500 of each:

- YES tokens decrease by 500
- NO tokens decrease by 500
- USDCe balance increases by 500

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#redeeming-after-resolution)  Redeeming After Resolution

After a market resolves, redeem winning tokens for USDCe.

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#check-resolution-status)  Check Resolution Status

Copy

```
// Via CLOB API
const market = await clobClient.getMarket(conditionId);
if (market.closed) {
  // Market is resolved
  const winningToken = market.tokens.find(t => t.winner);
  console.log("Winning outcome:", winningToken?.outcome);
}
```

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#redeem-winning-tokens)  Redeem Winning Tokens

Copy

```
const ctfInterface = new Interface([\
  "function redeemPositions(address collateralToken, bytes32 parentCollectionId, bytes32 conditionId, uint[] indexSets)"\
]);

const redeemTx: Transaction = {
  to: CTF_ADDRESS,
  data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("redeemPositions", [\
    USDCe_ADDRESS,\
    ethers.constants.HashZero,\
    conditionId,\
    [1, 2]  // Redeem both YES and NO (only winners pay out)\
  ]),
  value: "0"
};

const response = await client.execute([redeemTx], "Redeem winning tokens");
await response.wait();
```

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#payout)  Payout

- If YES wins: Each YES token redeems for $1 USDCe
- If NO wins: Each NO token redeems for $1 USDCe
- Losing tokens are worthless (redeem for $0)

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#negative-risk-markets)  Negative Risk Markets

Multi-outcome markets use the Negative Risk CTF Exchange. The split/merge process is similar but uses different contract addresses.

Copy

```
const NEG_RISK_ADAPTER = "0xd91E80cF2E7be2e162c6513ceD06f1dD0dA35296";
const NEG_RISK_CTF_EXCHANGE = "0xC5d563A36AE78145C45a50134d48A1215220f80a";
```

See [Negative Risk Overview](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/neg-risk/overview) for details.

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#inventory-strategies)  Inventory Strategies

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#pre-market-preparation)  Pre-market Preparation

Before quoting a market:

1. Check market metadata via Gamma API
2. Split sufficient USDCe to cover expected quoting size
3. Set token approvals if not already done

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#during-trading)  During Trading

Monitor inventory and adjust:

- Skew quotes when inventory is imbalanced
- Merge excess tokens to free up capital
- Split more when inventory runs low

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#post-resolution)  Post-Resolution

After market closes:

1. Cancel all open orders
2. Wait for resolution
3. Redeem winning tokens
4. Merge any remaining pairs

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/market-makers/inventory\#batch-operations)  Batch Operations

For efficiency, batch multiple operations:

Copy

```
const transactions: Transaction[] = [\
  // Split on Market A\
  {\
    to: CTF_ADDRESS,\
    data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("splitPosition", [\
      USDCe_ADDRESS,\
      ethers.constants.HashZero,\
      conditionIdA,\
      [1, 2],\
      ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 6)\
    ]),\
    value: "0"\
  },\
  // Split on Market B\
  {\
    to: CTF_ADDRESS,\
    data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("splitPosition", [\
      USDCe_ADDRESS,\
      ethers.constants.HashZero,\
      conditionIdB,\
      [1, 2],\
      ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 6)\
    ]),\
    value: "0"\
  }\
];

const response = await client.execute(transactions, "Batch inventory setup");
await response.wait();
```
