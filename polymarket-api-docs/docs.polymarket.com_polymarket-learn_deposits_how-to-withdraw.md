How to Withdraw

Withdrawing from Polymarket is simple, instant, and free.

Note: When withdrawing USDC.e (bridged USDC) is swapped through the [Uniswap v3 pool](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd36ec33c8bed5a9f7b6630855f1533455b98a418)
for USDC (native) (the UI enforces less than 10bp difference in output
amount). At times, this pool may be exhausted and for extremely large deposits
there might not be enough liquidity. If you are having withdraw issues, try
breaking your withdraw into smaller amounts or waiting for the pool to be
rebalanced. Additionally, you can select to withdraw USDC.e directly which
does not require any Uniswap liquidity; just be aware that some exchanges no
longer allow USDC.e to be deposited directly.
