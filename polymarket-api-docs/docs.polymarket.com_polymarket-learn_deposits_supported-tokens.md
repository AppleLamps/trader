## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/deposits/supported-tokens\#how-do-i-use-transfer-crypto)  **How do I use Transfer Crypto?**

The feature was designed to be one of the simplest ways to transfer your tokens into a dApp.![polymarket.comxd.png](https://mintcdn.com/polymarket-292d1b1b/YUHnSq4JdekVofRY/images/polymarket.comxd.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=YUHnSq4JdekVofRY&q=85&s=b0bfcc917f51f03c422947be7abcc5fc)

1. **Click on the Deposit button** and **select Transfer Crypto** as a source option
2. **Select which supported token and chain**your assets are on from the dropdown
   - Depending on your combination, this **may update the deposit address**
   - Only send **supported token-chain combinations**
     - Sending non-supported tokens may cause an irrecoverable loss
3. **Scan the QR code or copy the deposit address**and paste as the recipient in the withdrawal/transfer page of your exchange/wallet
   - This is where you’ll specify how much crypto you’re transferring
   - You **must send more than the minimum deposit** amount or the funds will not process
   - Always ensure to **double check the pasted address** versus that is shown on the widget to protect against clickjacking attempts
   - You can click on the **collapsible section at the bottom of the widget** for estimated price impact, slippage, delivery time, and our help guide
4. **Withdraw/transfer the tokens**from your exchange/wallet and wait until they’re reflected on the dApp
   - You will receive notifications on the Fun widget as your withdraw/transfer processes and completes as shown below
