TypeScript

Python

Copy

```
// No signer or credentials needed
const client = new ClobClient(
  "https://clob.polymarket.com",
  137
);

// All public methods available
const markets = await client.getMarkets();
const book = await client.getOrderBook(tokenId);
const price = await client.getPrice(tokenId, "BUY");
```

TypeScript

Python

Copy

```
// Create client with signer
const client = new ClobClient(
  "https://clob.polymarket.com",
  137,
  signer
);

// All public and L1 methods available
const newCreds = createApiKey();
const derivedCreds = deriveApiKey();
const creds = createOrDeriveApiKey();
```

TypeScript

Python

Copy

```
// Create client with signer and creds
const client = new ClobClient(
  "https://clob.polymarket.com",
  137,
  signer,
  creds,
  2, // Indicates Gnosis Safe proxy
  funder // Safe wallet address holding funds
);

const order = await client.createOrder({ /* ... */ });
const result = await client.postOrder(order);
const trades = await client.getTrades();
```

TypeScript

Python

Copy

```
// Create client with builder's authentication headers
import { BuilderConfig, BuilderApiKeyCreds } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

const builderCreds: BuilderApiKeyCreds = {
  key: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY!,
  secret: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_SECRET!,
  passphrase: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE!
};

const builderConfig: BuilderConfig = {
  localBuilderCreds: builderCreds
};

const client = new ClobClient(
  "https://clob.polymarket.com",
  137,
  signer,
  creds, // User's API credentials
  2,
  funder,
  undefined,
  false,
