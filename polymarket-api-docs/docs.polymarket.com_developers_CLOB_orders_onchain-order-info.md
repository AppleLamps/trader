## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/orders/onchain-order-info\#how-do-i-interpret-the-orderfilled-onchain-event)  How do I interpret the OrderFilled onchain event?

Given an OrderFilled event:

- `orderHash`: a unique hash for the Order being filled
- `maker`: the user generating the order and the source of funds for the order
- `taker`: the user filling the order OR the Exchange contract if the order fills multiple limit orders
- `makerAssetId`: id of the asset that is given out. If 0, indicates that the Order is a BUY, giving USDC in exchange for Outcome tokens. Else, indicates that the Order is a SELL, giving Outcome tokens in exchange for USDC.
- `takerAssetId`: id of the asset that is received. If 0, indicates that the Order is a SELL, receiving USDC in exchange for Outcome tokens. Else, indicates that the Order is a BUY, receiving Outcome tokens in exchange for USDC.
- `makerAmountFilled`: the amount of the asset that is given out.
- `takerAmountFilled`: the amount of the asset that is received.
- `fee`: the fees paid by the order maker
