New FAK Order Type

We’re excited to introduce a new order type soon to be available to all users: Fill and Kill (FAK). FAK orders behave similarly to the well-known Fill or Kil(FOK) orders, but with a key difference:

- FAK will fill as many shares as possible immediately at your specified price, and any remaining unfilled portion will be canceled.
- Unlike FOK, which requires the entire order to fill instantly or be canceled, FAK is more flexible and aims to capture partial fills if possible.
