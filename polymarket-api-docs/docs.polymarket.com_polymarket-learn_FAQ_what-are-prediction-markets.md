Market Prices = Probabilities: The price of shares in a prediction market represents the current probability of an event happening. For example, if shares of an event are trading at 20 cents, it indicates a 20% chance of that event occurring.

If you believe the actual probability of an event is higher than the market price suggests, you can buy shares. For instance, if you think a team has a better than 20% chance of winning, you would buy shares at 20 cents. If the event occurs, each share becomes worth $1, yielding a profit.

Unlike media narratives, which can be swayed by various biases, prediction markets offer a transparent view of where people genuinely believe we’re heading.
