## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/geoblock\#overview)  Overview

Polymarket restricts order placement from certain geographic locations due to regulatory requirements and compliance with international sanctions.
Before placing orders, builders should verify the location.

Orders submitted from blocked regions will be rejected. Implement geoblock checks
in your application to provide users with appropriate feedback before they attempt to trade.
