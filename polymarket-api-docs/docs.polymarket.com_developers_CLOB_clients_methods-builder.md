## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/clients/methods-builder\#client-initialization)  Client Initialization

Builder methods require the client to initialize with a separate authentication setup using
builder configs acquired from [Polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder)
and the `@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk` package.

- Local Builder Credentials

- Remote Builder Signing


TypeScript

Python

Copy

```
import { ClobClient } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
import { BuilderConfig, BuilderApiKeyCreds } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
  localBuilderCreds: new BuilderApiKeyCreds({
    key: process.env.BUILDER_API_KEY,
    secret: process.env.BUILDER_SECRET,
    passphrase: process.env.BUILDER_PASS_PHRASE,
  }),
});

const clobClient = new ClobClient(
  "https://clob.polymarket.com",
  137,
  signer,
  apiCreds, // The user's API credentials generated from L1 authentication
  signatureType,
  funderAddress,
  undefined,
  false,
  builderConfig
);
```

TypeScript

Python

Copy

```
import { ClobClient } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
});

const clobClient = new ClobClient(
  "https://clob.polymarket.com",
  137,
  signer,
  apiCreds, // The user's API credentials generated from L1 authentication
  signatureType,
  funder,
  undefined,
  false,
  builderConfig
);
```

```

Params

Copy

```
interface TradeParams {
  id?: string;
  maker_address?: string;
  market?: string;
  asset_id?: string;
  before?: string;
  after?: string;
}
```

Response

Copy

```
interface BuilderTradesPaginatedResponse {
  trades: BuilderTrade[];
  next_cursor: string;
  limit: number;
  count: number;
}

interface BuilderTrade {
  id: string;
  tradeType: string;
  takerOrderHash: string;
  builder: string;
  market: string;
  assetId: string;
  side: string;
  size: string;
  sizeUsdc: string;
  price: string;
  status: string;
  outcome: string;
