How Do I Export My Key?

[User Guide](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/get-started/what-is-polymarket) [For Developers](https://docs.polymarket.com/quickstart/overview) [Changelog](https://docs.polymarket.com/changelog/changelog)

Exporting your private key gives you direct control and security over your funds. This process is applicable if you’ve signed up via email.

**DO NOT** share your private key with other parties, platforms, or people. We will never ask for your private key.

1. Access the Export Link while signed into Polymarket: [https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket](https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket)
2. Sign-in on Magic.Link
3. Export Private Key. Once revealed, you should securely store the private key displayed, where others can’t access it.
4. Log out of Magic.Link
