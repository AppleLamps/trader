With Polymarket’s Liquidity Rewards Program, you can earn money by placing limit orders that help keep the market active and balanced.

## [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/liquidity-rewards\#overview)  Overview

- The closer your orders are to the market’s average price, the more you earn.
- The reward amount depends on how helpful your orders are in terms of size and pricing compared to others.
- The more competitive your limit orders, the more you can make.
- You get paid daily based on how much your orders add to the market, and can use our [Rewards page](https://polymarket.com/rewards) to check your current earnings for the day, which markets have rewards in place, as well as how much.
- The minimum reward payout is $1; amounts below this will not be paid.

Simply put, the more you help the market by placing good orders, the more rewards you earn!

### [​](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/liquidity-rewards\#viewing-rewards)  Viewing Rewards

The total rewards, max spread, and minimum shares required to earn rewards vary by market. You can view the rewards for a given market in its Order Book.

- On the Polymarket order book, you can hover over the Rewards text to see the amount of rewards available in total on each market.
- The blue highlighted lines correspond to the max spread — meaning the farthest distance your limit order can be from the midpoint of the market to earn rewards.
- In the example below, because the max spread is 3c, every order within 3c of the midpoint is eligible for rewards. If the midpoint is < $0.10, you need to have orders on both sides to qualify.
